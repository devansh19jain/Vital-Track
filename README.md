# Vital-Track

Description
This project is a prototype for monitoring different body vital and environmental conditions. The system uses a variety of sensors, including a temperature sensor, an environmental sensor, and a network connection. The data collected from these sensors is then displayed on a web dashboard and uploaded to a cloud platform for further data analysis and real-time monitoring.

Features
-> Monitors a variety of body vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure.
-> Monitors environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality.
-> Displays data on a web dashboard.
-> Uploads data to a cloud platform for further analysis.
-> Can be used to identify potential health problems.

Benefits
-> Helps people to monitor their health in real time.
-> Helps people to identify potential health problems early on.
-> Helps people to take steps to improve their health.
